# Godot Portal Demo

Experimenting with portals in Godot Engine

## Controls

WASD or arrow keys to move, E to pick up cube

## Issues

This implementation has several issues that need to be fixed before
the portals can be fully seamless. To fix all of them, Godot needs
support for [custom projection matrices](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/2713)
and [stencil buffering](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/23721), which
it doesn't have yet.

- Rendering
  - Oblique near-plane frustum for portal cameras
  - Fix performance with stencil buffering
  - Lighting through portals
  - Portal camera FOV sync with player FOV
  - Portal dynamic updating in editor (optional, but nice)
- Physics
  - Seamless first-person player teleportation
  - Fix holding RigidBody through portal
  - Collision masking for objects behind portal

## How it works

The full details are in the code, but basically, the portals behave as
described below.

### Rendering

Each portal has a camera attached to it, mapped to a `ViewportTexture`
on the linked portal. These cameras move based on the player position
such that angles look realistic.

### Physics

When a `RigidBody` overlaps the portal, it creates a clone at the
other portal. The clone and real object swap once the real object's
center goes behind its portal. This allows somewhat-seamless object
teleportation.
